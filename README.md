Simple Phone Book Application using Python

A lightweight, console-based Phone Book Manager built with Python. This project demonstrates how to use Python dictionaries to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contact data efficiently.

🚀**Features**

Add Contacts: Quickly store names and phone numbers.  

Search Records: Efficiently retrieve a phone number by searching for a contact's name.

Update Information: Easily modify the phone number of an existing contact.

Data Normalization: Automatically handles input formatting (stripping spaces and converting to lowercase) to ensure data consistency.

🛠️ **Technical Highlights**
Dictionary Management: Uses Python dict for high-performance data storage and retrieval.

Modular Functions: Logic is organized into specific functions (add, read, update) for better code readability and maintenance.

Clean Interface: A menu-driven system that allows users to perform multiple tasks in a single session.

Input Sanitization: Uses string methods to prevent errors caused by extra spaces or mixed casing.

📝 **Future Improvements**

Data Persistence: Implement File Handling to save contacts permanently.
Delete Function: Add a dedicated option to remove contacts from the dictionary.
Error Handling: Add validation to prevent crashes when non-numeric data is entered for phone numbers.
